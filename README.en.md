## At a glance: available features and near-term roadmap

> Status key: ✅ Available; 🗓️ Planned. The desktop development workspace, public Plugin Center, and Chinese DeepSeek controls are available today. Planned capabilities will be updated only after the corresponding workflow is runnable.

| Capability | Status | What it enables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plugin Discovery and recommendations** | ✅ | Read the public catalog automatically, browse featured, recently updated, ecosystem-popular, and scenario-based recommendations, and search by name, capability, or publisher. |
| **Public Plugin Center** | ✅ | Inspect exact versions, capabilities, permissions, compatibility, and risk, install online, and manage plugin enablement, updates, disabling, and removal. |
| **Desktop development workspace** | ✅ | Open local projects, manage sessions and workspaces, use Harness models, tools, Skills, and plugins, and modify the complete source code directly. |
| **Vision enhancement** | ✅ | Use one switch to select native DeepSeek image input or a verified cloud/self-hosted compatible vision route, with the active path visible in the composer. |
| **Local models and self-hosted inference** | ✅ | Connect conversation models through OpenAI-compatible Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, or custom endpoints; vision enhancement includes presets and real-image verification for the same local frameworks. |
| **Chinese DeepSeek controls** | ✅ | Choose Chinese permission levels and DeepSeek-specific thinking modes directly in the composer for the current session. |
| **Built-in skins and custom backgrounds** | ✅ | Start with the whale-maid skin, switch to Cloud Cat, or choose a local image and let the app adapt its interface palette. |
| **Standalone MCP, Skills, and tool management** | 🗓️ | Add discovery and connection management for MCP servers, Skills, and tools that are not distributed as Bundles, then compose Agent capabilities per project. |
| **Agent presets and multi-Agent collaboration** | 🗓️ | Define Agents and subagents that collaborate across coding, testing, research, and review work. |
| **Planning, background runs, and session recovery** | 🗓️ | Manage plans and tasks, keep long-running work active in the background, inspect progress, and resume previous sessions. |
| **Project rules, hooks, and durable memory** | 🗓️ | Manage repository instructions, automation hooks, and reusable context so Agents work consistently with project rules. |
| **Git, worktrees, and code review** | 🗓️ | Develop concurrently in isolated worktrees, inspect diffs, commits, and review results, and reduce interference between tasks. |
| **Browser and desktop automation** | 🗓️ | Let Agents operate websites and local applications, then verify completion through real interaction results. |
| **Mobile remote access and channels** | 🗓️ | Inspect and resume tasks from a mobile device, and receive notifications or trigger Agents through common messaging channels. |

## Project overview

DeepSeek Harness Studio uses Electron to host the DeepSeek Harness Web workspace. The desktop main process starts and manages a local `dsh web` service. This repository provides the complete development source so users can clone or download it, install dependencies, edit the code, launch the desktop app, and continue development.

Desktop installers are published only through this repository's GitHub Releases page, never through a third-party download site. Electron-validated macOS arm64 and Windows x64 development previews are available now, while the complete source remains available for local development.

## Core features

- **Electron desktop app**: application window, system tray, single-instance behavior, external-link handling, and a restricted preload bridge.
- **Local Harness Host**: the desktop main process starts `dsh web`, waits for the local service to become ready, and stops the Host process when the app exits.
- **Web workspace**: DeepSeek Harness sessions, workspaces, models, tools, Skills, and plugin runtime remain available.
- **Plugin Discovery and recommendations**: read the online catalog and use featured, recently updated, ecosystem-popular, scenario filters, and search to find plugins worth trying.
- **Agent-assisted plugin search**: describe a need in natural language and let the Agent search the public `dsh-plugin` catalog, rank relevant candidates, and explain each recommendation.
- **Public Plugin Center**: locate published DSH Bundles by short package name, full npm name, or an explicit GitHub repository; verify exact identity, artifact integrity, Bundle declaration, and local compatibility before installation. Aggregate Bundles may reuse DSH modules packaged with the current Desktop Host, while genuinely missing third-party dependencies remain blocked.
- **Preset Square**: browse Fufan Official and community Agent Presets from a first-class page, inspect their Skills, tools, and environment requirements, install them safely, and start a new session from the installed list.
- **Application Center**: launch complete AI applications maintained by the Fufan Desktop team; each application owns its interface, data, and runtime flow and can be shown or hidden in the sidebar.
- **Composer vision enhancement**: keep one switch; send original images when exact-model metadata declares image support, otherwise use a verified cloud or self-hosted compatible vision route, with each image entering exactly one path.
- **Local model connectivity**: use standard OpenAI-compatible interfaces for Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, or custom inference services. Studio owns routing and configuration but does not download or start model weights.
- **Desktop appearance settings**: built-in Whale Maid and Cloud Cat skins, plus local backgrounds, subject focus, and interface glass controls.
- **Complete development source**: desktop app, Web interface, CLI, capability packages, native helpers, Python SDK, examples, and build scripts are kept in the repository.

## DeepSeek Harness v0.1.1-rc.2 compatibility

Studio `0.1.0-rc.16` integrates the core and Web capabilities from DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` while retaining Beyondata's Plugin Center, Plugin Discovery, Preset Square, Application Center, themes, and desktop recovery flows. Studio and upstream Harness versions are managed independently; the download links above match this release.

- **Models and vision**: keeps Pro and Flash as text models; the single vision-enhancement control selects `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp`, while verified cloud and self-hosted compatible routes remain available for text models.
- **Attachments and references**: supports persistent image attachments, `@` file or session references, and image-bearing `/goal` and `/plan` input. Native DeepSeek images use reusable Files API uploads, bounded stale-reference retries, and a whole-request inline fallback when file resolution fails.
- **Plugins and settings**: renders plugin-provided dynamic settings cards while keeping installation, configuration, enablement, disabling, and removal in the existing Plugin Center flow.
- **Jobs and runtime**: integrates subagent jobs, concurrent Web Search, faster history forks, and persistent PowerShell PTY sessions on Windows.
- **Desktop compatibility**: starts the Desktop Host with `--no-open`, retains native directory selection and existing user-data locations, and automatically retries an incompatible historical plugin lockfile without rewriting it so Desktop does not remain trapped on recovery.

## Plugin ecosystem: discover what is worth installing, then manage it

### Plugin Discovery: start here when you do not know what to install

Not sure where to find plugins, which ones were updated recently, or what the ecosystem is paying attention to? Open **Plugin Discovery** from the sidebar. The app reads the online catalog automatically and turns scattered packages into a recommendation page you can browse and act on directly.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/plugin-discovery-desktop.png" alt="Real DeepSeek Harness Studio Plugin Discovery desktop interface" width="100%">
  <br><sub>Real Desktop interface: catalog feature, recently updated, ecosystem popular, scenario filters, search, and install or management actions.</sub>
</p>

- **A fresh place to start every day**: see catalog features, recently updated entries, and ecosystem-popular plugins without searching repositories one by one.
- **Filter by scenario**: browse Agents and workflows, Web UI, browser and search, vision and media, memory and context, models and services, developer tools, or integrations and notifications.
- **Search for the answer directly**: search by plugin name, capability keyword, or publisher, then inspect its icon, summary, version, and update time.
- **Act as soon as you discover it**: start the trusted installation flow for a new plugin, or jump to Plugin Center management for an installed one.

### Do not know the exact package name? Let the Agent shortlist it

When all you know is “I want a desktop pet,” you do not need to guess an npm package name first. Enter the need in **Plugin Discovery** and the app sends it to the current Agent as a `/find-plugins` request. The Agent loads the built-in Skill, performs a read-only search of the public `dsh-plugin` catalog, and returns the closest candidates with versions, publishers, update dates, and matching reasons in the current conversation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/plugin-agent-finder-desktop.webp" alt="Agent runs find-plugins in the real desktop client and returns five desktop-pet recommendations" width="100%">
  <br><sub>Real Desktop acceptance run: the conversation asks for a desktop-pet plugin; the Agent loads <code>find-plugins</code>, searches the public catalog, and lists five relevant candidates from eight results.</sub>
</p>

- **No catalog vocabulary required**: describe the outcome, use case, or problem in ordinary language.
- **Evidence stays inspectable**: each result includes the exact package name, version, publisher, update date, and a matching reason.
- **Search and installation remain separate decisions**: recommendations are public-catalog metadata only; after choosing a package, use **Plugin Center** for compatibility checks and installation confirmation.

### Plugin Center: install, enable, disable, and remove online

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/plugin-center-avatars-desktop.png" alt="Real DeepSeek Harness Studio public Plugin Center interface" width="100%">
  <br><sub>Real Desktop interface: plugin avatars, public catalog, Installed area, Install buttons, and three-dot management actions.</sub>
</p>

After choosing a plugin, open **Plugin Center** and search by short package name, full npm name, or an explicit GitHub repository for plugins and Skill Packs published to the public npm Registry in the DeepSeek Harness Bundle format. The `dsh-plugin` keyword is only a discovery signal, and GitHub is only used to map back to a published npm package; source is never installed directly.

- **Online discovery**: search public plugins and inspect versions, capabilities, permissions, compatibility, and risk.
- **One-click installation**: download and verify an exact package version, integrity metadata, and Bundle declaration; after confirmation, Desktop installs it, restarts the Harness Host, and verifies runtime state.
- **Installed management**: review system, public-catalog, and local sources together, then enable, disable, update, or uninstall an entry from its three-dot menu.
- **Safe removal**: uninstall retains configuration and plugin data by default; deleting data requires a separate user confirmation.

## Built-in skins and custom backgrounds

Open **Settings → Background** to switch built-in skins. For a custom image, the app performs the 1920×1080 WebP crop and interface color adaptation locally without uploading the original.

  </tr>

    <td><strong>Cloud Cat</strong><br>The original soft blue-and-white cat theme remains available as a calm, low-distraction option.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Chinese permissions and DeepSeek model controls

- **Permission selection**: the composer uses the Chinese `只读`, `工作区写入`, and `完全访问` labels for the current session. General settings affect only new sessions, and enabling Full access requires an explicit risk confirmation.
- **Model and thinking modes**: the model and API key remain managed in Settings. The composer shows the current DeepSeek model and offers `关闭思考`, `低强度思考`, `深度思考`, and `最大思考`.

## Local models and self-hosted inference

Studio can connect to model services running on the same machine or local network through standard OpenAI-compatible interfaces. Users start the inference server and load the model first; Studio does not download model weights, allocate deployment storage, or manage GPU runtime parameters.

| Framework | Default API base | Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ollama** | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` | Uses Ollama's OpenAI compatibility interface with the actual model ID; a local API key may be omitted. |
| **vLLM** | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1` | Connects to a vLLM OpenAI-compatible server with its loaded model ID and optional API key. |
| **SGLang** | `http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1` | Connects to an SGLang OpenAI-compatible endpoint with its running model ID and optional API key. |
| **Custom service** | User supplied | Supports other HTTP(S) services compatible with `/v1/chat/completions`. |

- **Conversation models**: add or edit a compatible provider under **Settings → Models**, then enter its API base, model ID, and optional credential.
- **Local vision models**: choose Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, or a custom service in vision-enhancement setup; the configuration is saved only after a real image succeeds.
- **No silent cloud fallback**: a failed self-hosted route never forwards the image to Bailian, OpenRouter, or another cloud provider.

## Vision enhancement: let DeepSeek understand images

When vision enhancement is enabled, the Host selects one route from the current exact model's capabilities: a model that declares image support receives the original image; otherwise, a configured and verified Bailian or OpenRouter-compatible provider supplies a traceable observation to the Agent. The routes are mutually exclusive, so each image is processed once.

- **Available in the composer**: use the “视觉增强” shortcut on the left side of the input bar; hover to see its purpose and current state.
- **Automatic path selection**: the shortcut reports `原生` or `兼容 · 提供方`; native vision needs no extra key, while compatible vision requires a verified provider.
- **Explicitly off**: disabling the switch keeps images out of model-visible context while retaining attachment history in the interface.
- **Built for development work**: understand product screenshots, error dialogs, designs, charts, photos, and text in images, or inspect an image by its workspace path.

## Download the desktop app

> GitHub Releases provides Electron-validated macOS Apple Silicon and Windows x64 development previews. Running either desktop build requires no separate Node.js or pnpm installation. These remain development-preview assets; formal releases will provide platform-signed macOS `.dmg` and Windows x64 `.exe` installers.

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/fufankeji/deepseek-harness-studio/releases/download/desktop-preview-v0.1.0-rc.16/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-0.1.0-rc.16-macos-arm64-preview.zip"><strong>Download the macOS arm64 preview</strong></a> · <a href="https://github.com/fufankeji/deepseek-harness-studio/releases/download/desktop-preview-v0.1.0-rc.16/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-Windows-x64-0.1.0-rc.16-Setup.exe"><strong>Download the Windows x64 installer</strong></a></p>

Development previews use a separate pre-release tag without triggering the formal installer workflow. Their public download area contains only the macOS ZIP and Windows installer; checksums, blockmaps, and platform-verification records remain in the corresponding GitHub Actions artifact so users do not mistake development files for installers. The formal workflow accepts only a `desktop-v*` tag that exactly matches the Desktop version, and publishes the macOS and Windows installers with `SHA256SUMS` only after both platform signatures pass verification.
